Automatic-Language-Identification
=================================

Parses text and determines the language of the text based on bigrams.

## Project Description

This Java project was done for my Concordia Artificial Intelligence course with Dr. Leila Kosseim.  The following are the requirements:

- system must be able to read training corpora into bigrams
- system must be able to use bigrams to identify the language of a given sentence

## Specifics

The system..

- considers all words as lower case
- considers if words are at the beginning or end of a sentence
- does not consider other punctuation such as apostrophes or commas
- assumes input will be devoid of diacritics
